‚ö†Ô∏è When your new icons has been published, you will need to create a new branch `update-version-X.X.X`, update the version for the correct version in the package.json at the root directory.

## How add a new icon?

Just add a new directory in `/src/icons`, create your new icon file `MyNewSVG.js` üêô

If you want to add a dependency to get more efficient, it's possible! Add it as a peer-dependency:
```
yarn add DEPENDENCY_NAME
```

In package.json, copy the line from peer and paste it into __peerDependencies__

Then, you will need to add your icon to Storybook, go to `/src/stories.js` and add the new story for your icon.

You will need to reference your new icon for export, to do that, open `/src/index.js` and add it:
```js
export { default as MyNewSVGIcon } from './icons/MyNewSVG';
```
